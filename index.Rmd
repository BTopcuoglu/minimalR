# Introduction

0	Introduction to R and RStudio

1	Ordination

* Plotting
* Symbols and colors
* Axis labels

2	Plotting metadata as an attribute

* Reading data files
* Survey of metadata
* Data clean up
* Subsetting data
* Plotting metadata on top of scatter data

3	Plotting pairs of continuous data with scatter plots

* dplyr joins
* Legends
* Margins
* Calculating correlations

4	Plotting continuous by categorical data

* Functions
* Sourcing R scripts
* Controlling flow with `ifelse`
* Aggregating function
* Matrices
* Barplots - Legends; from Vectors, Matrices, t(Matrices)
* Error bar - standard deviation

5 Working with random data

* Histograms - are data normally distributed?
* Density plots
* Points
* Transforming data
* Generate random data
* Saving plots

6	Plotting non-normal data

* Box plots
* Custom box plot (building your own plots)
*	Strip charts
* Over plotting line for median

7	Line plots

* Regular expressions - grep and gsub
* Rarefaction curves
* Building plots
* Loops

8 Working with OTU data

* String manipulations - strsplit and paste
* Regular expressions - more complex patterns
* Apply functions
* if ... else

9	Plotting taxonomic data

* Pie charts
* Stacked bar plots
* Bar plots
* Strip charts

10	Finding relevant OTUs to plot

* Kruskal-Wallis test
* Correcting for multiple hypotheses
* Plotting OTU data
* Getting help
